mart Campus Assistant – Project Documentation
1. Project Overview
1.1 Title

Smart Campus Assistant

1.2 Objective

To develop a Smart Campus Assistant system that leverages AI, IoT, and mobile technologies to enhance campus life by automating services like navigation, event alerts, facility booking, attendance, and information access.

2. Scope of the Project

Students can access real-time data about classes, schedules, events, and facilities.

Faculty can manage lectures, attendance, and communicate easily with students.

Visitors can navigate the campus and find relevant information.

Admins can monitor systems, manage infrastructure, and gather insights.
